# DentistAppoitnments

This is a program that manages appointments for a dentist's office. 

There are two main classes, Patient and Appointment. 
Patient manages the patients so that you can add a name, age and other stuff related to different patients.
Appointment manages the patients that came to make an appointment and to set them at a different hour in the day, so that there can not be two appointments in the same hour at the same doctor.
